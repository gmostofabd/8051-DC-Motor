	<h3>Introduction:</h3>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				A DC motor (Direct Current motor) is the most common type of motor. 
				 Interfacing DC Motor to a microcontroller forms an essential 
				part in designing embedded robotic projects. 
				This article shows how to interface a small DC motor with any 
				microcontroller. Before working with DC motors we will take a 
				look at some basic techniques for controlling them. There are 
				several types of DC motors, but here we will use a simple brushed DC motor.
			</p>

	<h3>Hardware Discussion : DC Motor</h3>

			<span class="capt_cont">Fig: DC Motor</span></div>

		<blockquote>
			<p>
				DC motors normally have just two leads, one positive and one 
				negative. If you connect these two leads directly to a battery, 
				the motor will rotate. If you switch the leads, the motor will 
				rotate in the opposite direction. 
				
				<br><br> Driving electromotors needs a high current. In addition, 
				spinning direction and speed are two important parameters to be controlled. 
				These requirements can be handled by using a microcontroller or similar. But 
				there is a problem; Microcontrollers cannot provide enough 
				current to run the motor and if you connect the motor to the 
				microcontroller directly, you may damage the microcontroller. 
				The perfect solution is to use a motor driver circuit in 
				between the microcontroller and the DC motor.
			</p>

	<h3>DC Motor Features:</h3>
		<ul>
		  <li>Runs on DC power or AC line voltage with a rectifier.</li>
		  <li>No need for a drive circuit when running at constant speed.</li>
		  <li>Able to operate at high speeds (1,000 to 5,000 rpm.)</li>
		  <li>High-efficiency design (60-75\% Approx).</li>
		  <li>High starting torque.</li>
		  <li>Responsive and easy to use as speed and torque can be controlled by voltage.</li>
		  <li>Can be divided into brushed and brushless DC motors.</li>
		</ul>

	<h3>Controlling a DC Motor:</h3>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				In order to have a complete control over DC motor, we have 
				to control its speed and rotation direction. The DC motor 
				speed can be controlled by applying varying DC voltage; 
				whereas the direction of rotation of the motor can be 
				changed by reversing the direction of current through it. 
				This can be achieved by combining these two common 
				techniques.
			</p>
		</blockquote>

		<blockquote>
		<p>
		<strong>PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) –</strong>
		For controlling speed <br><br>
		It is a technique where average value of the input 
		voltage is adjusted by sending a series of ON-OFF 
		pulses.<br><br>
		The average voltage is proportional to the width 
		of the pulses known as Duty Cycle. The higher the 
		duty cycle, the greater the average voltage being 
		applied to the dc motor(High Speed) and the lower 
		the duty cycle, the less the average voltage being 
		applied to the dc motor(Low Speed).
		</p>
		</blockquote>

  		<div class="box_70"><img src="assets/images/pwm1.png"/></div>

		<blockquote>
		<p>
		<strong>H-Bridge –</strong>
		For controlling rotation direction<br><br>
		An H bridge is an electronic circuit which allows 
		the voltage to be flown in either direction. 
		H-bridges are used in many different applications, 
		one of the most common being to control motors in 
		robots. It is called an H-bridge because it uses 
		four transistors connected in such a way that the 
		schematic diagram looks like an "H."<br><br>
		
		Closing two particular switches at the same time reverses 
		the polarity of the voltage applied to the motor. 
		This causes change in spinning direction of the motor.
		</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>
				You can use discrete transistors to make this circuit, but for 
				this tutorial, we will be using the L293D H-Bridge IC. The L293D 
				can control the speed and direction of DC motors and stepper 
				motors and can control two motors simultaneously. Its current 
				rating is 1.2A for each motor. At these currents, however, you 
				will need to use heat sinks.

				The circuit shown below is of an 8051 based  bi directional motor  
				whose direction can be controlled using 2 push button 
				switches. The circuit is very similar to the previous one 
				except  for the  two push button switches . These pushbutton
				switches are interfaced to  P0rt 3 of the microcontroller. 
				Resistors R2 and R3 are the pull down resistors for P3.0 
				and 3.1 respectively.

				jump if not equal instruction. In simple words the CJNE 
				instruction compares two operands and jump to a predefined 
				LABEL  if the operands are not equal. If the two operands 
				are equal nothing happens and the next instruction is 
				executed.  Whenever push button S2 is pressed the status 
				of P3 will be 00000001B .This status is moved to accumulator
				A and compared with 00000001B using the CJNE instruction. 
				Both operands are equal means S2 is pressed and the next 
				instruction (MOV P1,\#00000001B) which makes the motor run 
				clockwise is executed. If the operands are not equal that 
				means the S2 is not pressed and the controller jumps to 
				LABEL1 which is to check the S3. To check S3, status of 
				P3 is moved to A again  and it is compared with 00000010B 
				using the CJNE instruction. Both operands are equal means 
				the S3 is pressed and the next 
				instruction (MOV P1,\#00000010B) which makes the motor 
				run anti clockwise is executed. Both operands are not 
				equal means S3 is not pressed and the controller goes 
				to check  S2 again and this cycle is repeated.
