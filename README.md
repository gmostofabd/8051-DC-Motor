# ‚öôÔ∏è Understanding DC Motor Operation and Speed Control ‚öôÔ∏è

DC motors are widely used in electronics and robotics due to their ease of control and efficiency. In this guide, we will explore the fundamental modes of operation and techniques to regulate the speed of DC motors.

### üöÄ  Introduction

A DC Motor and Phidgets DC Motor Controller
DC Motors are the simplest way to turn electrical power into physical motion.

They can be found in all types of applications, from power tools, to remote control cars, to large industrial machinery.




### üöÄ  What are DC Motors?
Like AC motors, DC motors also convert electrical energy into mechanical energy. Their operation is the reverse of a DC generator which produces an electric current. Unlike AC motors, DC motors operate on DC power‚Äìnon-sinusoidal, unidirectional power. 



### üöÄ  Basic Construction
Although DC motors are designed in various ways, they all contain the following basic parts:

Rotor (the part of the machine that rotates; also known as the ‚Äúarmature‚Äù)
Stator (the field windings, or ‚Äústationary‚Äù part of the motor)
Commutator (can be brushed or brushless, depending on the motor type)
Field magnets (provide the magnetic field that turns an axle connected to the rotor)
In practice, DC motors work based on interactions between magnetic fields produced by a rotating armature and that of the stator or fixed component.

 

### üöÄ  Operating Principle
DC motors operate on Faraday‚Äôs principle of electromagnetism which states that a current-carrying conductor experiences a force when placed in a magnetic field. According to Fleming‚Äôs ‚ÄúLeft-hand rule for electric motors,‚Äù the motion of this conductor is always in a direction perpendicular to the current and the magnetic field. 

Mathematically, we can express this force as F = BIL (where F is force, B is the magnetic field, I stand for current, and L is the length of the conductor). 

 



### üöÄ  Why Speed Control of a DC Motor is Important?
By allowing flexible adjustment of rotational speed, DC motors with speed control can meet the varying throughput demands in industrial machines. For example, conveyor motors may require slow speeds for loading and higher speeds for transfers. Efficient speed regulation also finds applications in robotics, CNC machines, medical equipment, electric vehicles, and more. It enables smooth transitions without sudden jerks, reducing wear and mechanical stresses. Precise control over velocity also ensures high-quality output and repeatability in operations.

### üöÄ  Speed control of a DC motor is vital for several reasons:

Precision in Applications: Many applications require precise speed control for efficient operation.
Energy Efficiency: Proper speed control can lead to significant energy savings.
Enhanced Performance: Adjusting speed ensures the motor performs optimally under varying loads.
Extended Motor Life: Controlled speed reduces wear and tear, prolonging the motor's lifespan








## üéØ **Key Concepts**

### 1. üîã **Voltage Control**
By adjusting the **applied voltage**, you can control the speed of a DC motor. A higher voltage increases speed, while reducing voltage slows it down.

### 2. ‚ö° **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)**
PWM is a highly efficient method for controlling the speed of DC motors. It works by rapidly switching the power on and off, adjusting the **duty cycle** to change the motor's speed without wasting energy.

- üí° **Higher Duty Cycle**: More power, higher speed.
- üí° **Lower Duty Cycle**: Less power, lower speed.

### 3. üîÑ **Current Control**
In **current control**, the motor's torque is regulated by managing the current flowing through it. This is particularly useful in applications requiring precise torque control, such as robotic arms.

## üìâ **Speed Regulation Techniques**

Here are the most common techniques for regulating the speed of DC motors:

1. **Variable Voltage Supply**: Adjusting the input voltage using variable resistors or power electronics.
2. **PWM Speed Control**: Modifying the duty cycle to efficiently manage speed without overheating the motor.
3. **Feedback Systems**: Using sensors like encoders or tachometers to dynamically adjust motor speed for greater precision.

### üöÄ  Types of DC Motors
DC motors fall into different categories, depending on their construction. The most common types include brushed or brushless, permanent magnet, series, and parallel.  

 

### üöÄ  Brushed and Brushless Motors
A brushed DC motor utilizes a pair of graphite or carbon brushes which are for conducting or delivering current from the armature. These brushes are usually kept in close proximity to the commutator. Other useful functions of brushes in dc motors include ensuring sparkless operation, controlling the direction of current during rotation, and keeping the commutator clean. 

Brushless DC motors do not contain carbon or graphite brushes. They usually contain one or more permanent magnets that spin around a fixed armature. In place of brushes, brushless DC motors utilize electronic circuits to control the direction of rotation and speed. 

 

### üöÄ  Permanent Magnet Motors
Permanent magnet motors consist of a rotor surrounded by two opposing permanent magnets. The magnets supply a magnetic field flux when dc is passed, which causes the rotor to spin in a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction, depending on the polarity. A major benefit of this type of motor is that it can operate at synchronous speed with a constant frequency, allowing for optimal speed regulation. 

 

### üöÄ  Series-wound DC Motors
Series motors have their stator (usually made of copper bars) windings and field windings (copper coils) connected in series. Consequently, the armature current and field currents are equal. High current flows directly from the supply into the field windings which are thicker and fewer than in shunt motors. The thickness of the field windings increases the load-carrying capacity of the motor and also produces powerful magnetic fields that give series DC motors a very high torque.

 

### üöÄ  Shunt DC Motors
A shunt DC motor has its armature and field windings connected in parallel. Owing to the parallel connection, both windings receive the same supply voltage, although they are excited separately. Shunt motors typically have more turns on the windings than series motors which creates powerful magnetic fields during operation. Shunt motors can have excellent speed regulation, even with varying loads. However, they usually lack the high starting torque of series motors. 



This feature allows you to set up your system so you only need to tell the motor where to go with a given speed and acceleration, and it will go there.

### üöÄ  Torque, Current and Power
Now that we have covered the basics of using DC motors and how easily they can be controlled with Phidgets, we can cover more in-depth concerns, such as torque curves and power consumption.


A DC Motor Draws More Current Under Load
A DC Motor‚Äôs torque is proportional to the electrical current flowing through it. The more current, the harder the motor pushes to get moving. A higher supply voltage will try to push more current, and allow a higher maximum torque for a given motor.

As a DC motor spins faster, it begins trying to generate its own current to oppose the motion. So long as the motor is powered, this results in a reduced current driving the motor. Under no load, the motor will spin up to the point where this generated electromotive force (EMF) cancels out the supply, and the system consumes barely any power while spinning as fast as it can.

As the motor gets loaded down, the motor slows allowing more current to flow and generating more torque to fight the load. This tendency of the motor to consume more current at low speeds means that the DC Motor will work harder when it‚Äôs weighed down, and when it‚Äôs starting up.


Thermal Image of a Stalled DC Motor
Once the motor is loaded down to the point it can no longer spin, it will consume as much current as it can, generating maximum torque, but potentially overheating in the process. Overloading an electric motor to this point is called a ‚Äústall‚Äù and should be avoided.

To prevent problems caused by this kind of runaway current, Phidgets DC Motor Controllers have a current limiting feature. This can be useful in both preventing overheating and/or automatically limiting the available torque if desired.

### üöÄ  Braking

A DC motor can be made to passively resist fast movement
Another result of the electromotive forces (EMF) caused by the spinning motor is that by connecting the motor terminals together when it‚Äôs spinning, the motor will produce a current (and thus a force) opposing the rotation of the motor. This method of using the motor‚Äôs own rotation against itself is called braking.

When braking, a faster rotation generates a higher EMF, resulting in a higher braking current, and the motor will brake harder when it‚Äôs spinning faster.

A DC Motor that is not moving will generate no passive braking, as no motion results in no EMF being generated, and thus no current and no torque.


A Phidgets DC Motor controller can be used to control the braking force applied by your DC motor.
