This repository demonstrates how to interface a DC motor with the 8051 microcontroller using the **L298** driver to handle the extra current required to run the motor. The project includes complete assembly code, Proteus simulation files, and documentation, along with screenshots and photos from testing.

## üì¶ **Project Overview**
The project showcases the integration of a **DC motor** with the **AT89C51** microcontroller, part of the 8051 family. The DC motor is driven via the **L298** H-Bridge motor driver, which provides the necessary current amplification to control the motor's direction and speed efficiently. The Proteus simulation files allow you to visualize and test the functionality before implementing it on hardware.

### **Key Features:**
- **DC Motor Control**: Forward and reverse motor control using the 8051 microcontroller.
- **L298 Driver**: Used to supply the necessary current for the DC motor operation.
- **Proteus Simulation**: Includes simulation files for DC motor interfacing with the 8051 MCU.
- **Test Results**: Screenshots and photos from actual tests provide insights into the project's performance.

## üîß **Hardware Components**
- **AT89C51 Microcontroller**: Manages control signals for the DC motor.
- **L298**: H-Bridge motor driver, used to control the direction and speed of the DC motor.
- **DC Motor**: The motor being controlled by the microcontroller and driver circuit.
- **Power Supply**: Provides the necessary voltage and current for the system.

## üñ•Ô∏è **Simulation & Testing**
This project was simulated using **Proteus Design Suite** to verify the DC motor's behavior and control before real-world implementation. The repository includes:
- Assembly code for controlling the DC motor.
- Proteus simulation file showing motor operation.
- Screenshots and photos taken during the testing phase.
